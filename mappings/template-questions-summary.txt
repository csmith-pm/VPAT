         Table: 2, Row: 30, Weight: 2
  [AUTO] Functionality that is triggered by moving the device (such as shaking or panning a mobile device) or by user movement (such as waving to a camera) can be disabled and equivalent functionality is provided via standard controls like buttons.

         Table: 3, Row: 9, Weight: 2
  [AUTO] When a user inputs information or interacts with a control, it does not result in a substantial change to the page, the spawning of a pop-up window, an additional change of keyboard focus, or any other change that could confuse or disorient the user unless the user is informed of the change ahead of time.
         Table: 3, Row: 10, Weight: 2
